# Restaurant Search

---

Restaurant Search is a React Native app that lets people search restaurants in the Los Angeles area. The app
filters the results from cheapest to mid price to priciest so users can decide which restaurant to go based on their budget.
To use the app, simply search a term on the search bar and it will get the results. Users can then click on the restaurant to see more
images from the restaurant.
